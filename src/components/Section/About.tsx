          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I'm a software developer stretched between web technologies and space exploration.</p>
          <p>
            From my early years I was curious about new technologies and space is the cutting edge of it.
            Since 2011 I work as a web developer in <a href="http://byteout.com">Byteout Software</a>, where
            I try
            to converge these two.
          </p>
          <p>I also took a role of NASA SpaceApp Challenge local lead in Belgrade, Serbia.</p>
          <p>Every project is a mission and failure is not an option. It serves to organize and measure the
            best
            of our energies and skills, as spoke President Kennedy. Web and mobile apps are at my primal
            focus,
            and I always try to make my code lightweight and robust. When there's a problem, trying to see
            it as
            a challenge and a chance for growth.</p>
          <p>In my project management I'm inspired by word of Gene Kranz, who said that job we do requires
            toughness and competence. Toughness means we hold ourselves forever responsible for what we do
            and
            what we fail to do, and competence means we take nothing for granted.</p>
